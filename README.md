- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarahfreire2710
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and visualisations, leaning towards DeFi analysis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different coding languages (SQL, R, Python) as well as different 
applications for data visualisation (Power Query, Power BI, Tableau). I've also taken an interest in cryptocurrencies 
and am watching the DeFi space very closely. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a small project where I can use these new skills I've learnt.
- 📫 How to reach me sarahfreiresa@gmail.com
